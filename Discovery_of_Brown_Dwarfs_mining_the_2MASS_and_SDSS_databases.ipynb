    "# Discovery of brown dwarfs mining the 2MASS and SDSS database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the EURO-VO tutorial of the same name, which can be found here: http://www.euro-vo.org/sites/default/files/documents/tutorial-brown-dwarfs_2019Apr.pdf \n",
    "\n",
    "Brown dwarfs are objects occupying the gap between the least massive stars and the most massive planets. They are intrinsically faint objects so their detection is not straightforward and, in fact, was almost impossible until the advent of global surveys at deep optical and near-infrared bands like SDSS, 2MASS or DENIS among others. We propose here to mine the 2MASS point source catalogue (2MASS-PSC) and SDSS-DR9 databases to identify T-type brown dwarfs through an appropriate combination of colours in the optical and the infrared, an approach that perfectly fits into the Virtual Observatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of this tutorial\n",
    "In this use case, we explore different ways to do the same tasks with different VO tools. These tasks\n",
    "include:\n",
    " - obtaining data from the SDSS and 2MASS catalogues in a given sky region,\n",
    " - crossmatching the results of these searches,\n",
    " - filtering the resulting table for brown dwarfs, and\n",
    " - verifying our sample of brown dwarfs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software packages needed for this tutorial are Aladin, TOPCAT, STILTS and Python (or you may just use the Binder in your web browser)."

Now the primary SDSS source for this brown dwarf is classified as an extended source by the automated SDSS pipeline, probably because it is hardly detected and very faint.
