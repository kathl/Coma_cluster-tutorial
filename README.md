# Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use virtual observatory tools and services from within a Jupyter notebook to measure the redshift and velocity dispersion of the Coma Cluster. It is based on a EURO-VO tutorial also called "Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies". It can be found on this webpage: http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials

Don't worry about the postBuild and requirements.txt files, they are needed to get the Binder running.
