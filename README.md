# VO tutorials in Python

This repository includes all the VO tutorials that I translated into Jupyter notebooks so far.

Based on the EURO-VO scientific tutorials (http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials), I started to create tutorials on how to access the Virtual Observatory with Python. These tutorials are presented as Jupyter notebooks and are collected in this repository.


## Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies
This tutorial demonstrates how to use virtual observatory tools and services from within a Jupyter notebook to measure the redshift and velocity dispersion of the Coma Cluster. It is based on a EURO-VO tutorial also called "Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies".

## The CDS tutorial
This tutorial is a short demonstration of the CDS services within a Jupyter notebook. You will learn how to use the Aladin Lite widget for Jupyter Notebooks and how to query VizieR with astroquery. It is based in the EURO-VO tutorial called "The CDS tutorial". 

## Notes on the file structure
The files you will be mostely intrested in are the ones ending in .ipynb. These are the Jupyter notebooks, that you may run in the Binder or on your personal machine. 

The two folders Images and Data contain images used in the text section of the notebooks and data that is downloaded in course of the tutorial. 

Don't worry about the postBuild and requirements.txt files, they are only needed to get the Binder running. Note, however, that the requirements.txt files, tells you which versions of which packages are used in the Notebooks.

The README.md is the file you are reading right now :)
