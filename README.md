# VO tutorials in Python

This repository includes all the VO tutorials that I translated into Jupyter notebooks so far.

Based on the EURO-VO scientific tutorials (http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials), I started to create tutorials on how to access the Virtual Observatory with Python. These tutorials are presented as Jupyter notebooks and are collected in this repository.


## Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies
This tutorial demonstrates how to use virtual observatory tools and services from within a Jupyter notebook to measure the redshift and velocity dispersion of the Coma Cluster. It is based on a EURO-VO tutorial also called "Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies".


Don't worry about the postBuild and requirements.txt files, they are needed to get the Binder running.
