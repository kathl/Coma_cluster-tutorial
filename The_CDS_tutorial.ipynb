    "# CDS services in jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Welcome to a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to access some CDS services with Python. Jupyter notebooks offer an interactive way to use Python. If you are viewing this notebook with Binder you can execute every cell of code either by pushing the little 'play' <img src=\"Images/jupyter_run-cell.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:70px; display: inline-block;\"/> symbol on the left of the cell (appears when the mouse pointer moves in its vincitity) or by selecting a cell and pressing 'Shift' + 'Enter' at the same time. Note that cells that have not yet been executed have no number assigned to them, later on they are assigned the number of the order in which they were executed. If they are run again, they get a new number. \n",

    "Python draws its power from the large variety of packages that are available for everyone to install and use. For this tutorial we will be using two packages: `ipyaladin` (https://github.com/cds-astro/ipyaladin, allows to load Aladin Lite in a jupyter notebook) and `Vizier` from the `astroquery` package (https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#introduction, allows to query VizieR from this notebook). Let's import these packages by running the following cell:"

This widget is supposed to **center** on the Antennae galaxies, set a **field of view** of 0.7deg and show colour images from the DSS **survey**.

Hence, we ask `Vizier` to find all catalogues that have a match with the keywords 'Arp Webb' and write the result into the variable `catalog_list_arp` (first line of code).
